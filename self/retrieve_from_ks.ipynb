       "   'content': '# Azure AI Services for Language\\r\\n\\r\\nCompleted\\r\\n\\r\\n- 5 minutes\\r\\n\\r\\nAzure Cognitive Services for Language is a cloud-based service that provides natural language processing features for understanding and analyzing text. This service helps build intelligent applications by using the web-based Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Language Studio, REST APIs, and client libraries. This language service unifies commonly used services such as text analytics, QnA Maker, and Language Understanding (LUIS), and it provides several new features.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese features can be one of the following types:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Preconfigured** - These prebuilt AI models are intended for easier consumption, so they aren\\'t customizable. You can send your data and use the feature\\'s output in your applications.\\r\\n- **Customizable** - You\\'ll train an AI model by using the tools to fit your data specifically.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Azure Cognitive Services for Language, you can accomplish multiple tasks:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Extract information** - Use natural language processing to extract information from unstructured text. For example, it can identify key phrases or personal data, summarize text, recognize and categorize named entities, or customize an entity extraction model on top of your domain set.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Summarize text-based content** - Allows you to summarize lengthy documents and conversation transcripts.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Classify text** - Use natural language processing to detect the language or classify the sentiment of the text that you have. You can also classify your text documents by customizing a classification model over your dataset.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Answer questions** - Provide answers to questions that are being asked in unstructured texts by using the prebuilt capabilities, or you can customize your domain-specific, question-and-answer pairs over data that you provide.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Understand conversations** - Create your own models to classify conversational utterances and extract detailed information from them to fulfill scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Translate text** - Use cloud-based machine translation to build intelligent, multilanguage solutions for your applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nMicrosoft Copilot Studio agents can use many features that are associated with the preceding items to help make the agent more efficient and allow it to handle various scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvailable components of Azure Cognitive Services for Language include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Entity linking** - Identifies and extracts entities that are found in text. For example, in the sentence \"We went to Seattle last week,\" the word *Seattle* would be identified, with a link to more information on Wikipedia. For more information, see [entity linking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/entity-linking/overview/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n- **Named entity recognition** - Identifies and categorizes entities in unstructured text, such as people, places, organizations, and quantities. For more information, see [named entity recognition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/named-entity-recognition/overview/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n- **Sentiment** - Helps you discover what people think of your brand or topic by *mining* text for clues about positive or negative sentiment. It can associate the positive and negative sentiment with specific aspects of the text. For more information, see [sentiment analysis and opinion mining](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/overview/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n- **Detect language** - Detects the language that a document is written in and then returns a language code for a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages. For more information, see [language detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/language-detection/overview/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n- **Detect personal information** - Identifies, categorizes, and redacts sensitive information in unstructured text, such as phone numbers, email addresses, and forms of identification. For more information, see [personally identifiable information (PII) detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/personally-identifiable-information/overview/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n- **Key phrases** - Identifies the main concepts in text. For example, in the text \"The food was delicious and the staff were wonderful,\" key phrase extraction will return the main topics of *food* and *wonderful staff*. For more information, see [key phrase extraction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/key-phrase-extraction/overview/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, you could use the **Detect personal information** feature to analyze information in a conversation to extract a phone number, email address, or street address. This information could be based on other services, such as your organization\\'s customer relationship management (CRM) system, to identify the corresponding customer record. After you\\'ve identified the appropriate record, all information that\\'s associated with that customer in your CRM application could be made available to your Microsoft Copilot Studio agent to use. This feature allows you to create a more personalized experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of this module focuses on how to set up a Microsoft Copilot Studio agent to use Azure Cognitive Services for Language in the agent.

       "   'content': '# Azure Cognitive Services basics\\r\\n\\r\\nCompleted\\r\\n\\r\\n- 8 minutes\\r\\n\\r\\nText Analytics for health is a preconfigured feature of Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service for Language, which provides natural language processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. Azure Cognitive Service for Language has unified the previously standalone Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS services into a single service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Text Analytics for health AI model is trained on health-specific data. By using Text Analytics for health, you can perform named entity recognition, relation extraction, entity linking, and assertion detection with a single API call. The following functions are essential in processing unstructured health text:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Named entity recognition** - Extracts words and phrases that are mentioned in the text, such as diagnosis, symptoms, or medication names.\\r\\n- **Relation extraction** - Identifies connections between entities that are mentioned in the text. For example, the time of condition relation would be identified as 6:30 this morning for the symptom of a sore throat.\\r\\n- **Entity linking** - Identifies entities in text and then links the entity to well-known clinical ontologies based on the [Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n- **Assertion** - Results include assertion modifiers that are assigned to medical concepts to provide a deeper understanding of the concept in the text. For example, an assertion could indicate if the text that\\'s contained in a statement is about the patient not being short of breath. The assertion would indicate that the patient was negative for the symptom.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\\'ll further explore each feature later in this module. These features are essential for structuring the text that\\'s entered into a structure that can be useful.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Provision Text Analytics for health\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can use Text Analytics for health as a cloud service, or you can deploy it by using Docker containers. By using the cloud service, you can use the API immediately after provisioning. Conversely, the container option allows you to bring the service closer to your data for compliance, security, and other operational reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first step in using Text Analytics for health is to create a new language resource that\\'s associated with your Azure subscription. During creation, you\\'ll specify a resource group, resource name, and location that\\'s typically best to be close to your usage location.\\r\\n\\r\\nA key selection when you create a language resource is the [Pricing Tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service/?azure-portal=true), which is free or standard. Selecting **Free** will allow you a limited number of requests each month, and it\\'s limited from some of the service\\'s full capabilities. We recommend that you select the **Standard** service level for most production usage. For example, using Microsoft Azure Language Studio or containers for deployment are examples that require the standard service. You can change the pricing tier after you\\'ve created the language resource, if necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Use Text Analytics for health\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a language resource deployment completed, you can now use Text Analytics for health. Depending on your needs, multiple options are available regarding how you can use the service:\\r\\n\\r\\n- REST API\\r\\n- SDKs - Available for .NET, Python, Java, and Node.js\\r\\n- Microsoft Azure Logic Apps\\r\\n- Microsoft Power Automate\\r\\n- Language Studio\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all these options, you\\'re interacting with the endpoint from your provisioned language resource or your deployed container.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe REST API provides the lowest level access and can work with any coding language that\\'s capable of using REST APIs. The SDKs provide the benefit of having a more structured interaction and objects that represent the return data. The following example uses the .NET SDK to call the service and then list the found entities.\\r\\n\\r\\n```dotnetcli\\r\\nAnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesOperation healthOperation = await client.StartAnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesAsync(batchInput);\\r\\n            await healthOperation.WaitForCompletionAsync();\\r\\n            await foreach (AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResultCollection documentsInPage in healthOperation.Value)\\r\\n            {\\r\\n                Console.WriteLine($\"Results of Azure Text Analytics for health async model, version: \\\\\"{documentsInPage.ModelVersion}\\\\\"\");\\r\\n                Console.WriteLine(\"\");\\r\\n\\r\\n                foreach (AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResult entitiesInDoc in documentsInPage)\\r\\n                {\\r\\n                    if (!entitiesInDoc.HasError)\\r\\n                    {\\r\\n                        foreach (var entity in entitiesInDoc.Entities)\\r\\n                        {\\r\\n                            // view recognized healthcare entities\\r\\n                            Console.WriteLine($\"  Entity: {entity.Text}\");\\r\\n                        }\\r\\n  \\r\\n                }\\r\\n            }\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAzure Logic Apps and Power Automate provide a declarative option for creating workflows that include Text Analytics for health. By using the Azure Cognitive Service for Language connector, you can create flows that process unstructured health text as part of their logic. The following example is of a Power Automate cloud flow looping through each entity that\\'s returned from the Async Healthcare operation.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Use Language Studio\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quickest way to use the feature is to use Language Studio, which allows you to explore how Text Analytics for health works without writing code. You can provide the text that you want to process or a file that contains the text. Language Studio makes the request and then displays the results. A helpful visual tool in Language Studio shows the results, allowing you to view the result of processing the data and identifying entities and relationships. The following example shows the results of a request.\\r\\n\\r\\nLanguage Studio is a great way to prototype your application and understand how Text Analytics for health would process your data. The **JSON** tab shows full details of the response that\\'s represented in JSON. The **JSON** tab contains the same data that your application would make available to you to process the response.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Data privacy, security, and transparency\\r\\n\\r\\nData is temporarily stored by Azure Cognitive Service for Language for up to 48 hours and then it\\'s purged. The data is encrypted, and only authorized, on-call engineers can access the encrypted data for debugging purposes when a catastrophic failure occurs and a service support request is raised. You can prevent temporary storage of data by using the **LoggingOptOut** query parameter. The **LoggingOptOut** parameter is **true** by default for the health feature endpoints. When you\\'re using the container option, no request data will be sent to the cloud, only telemetry data will be sent for billing purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information, see [Azure Cognitive Service for Language data privacy and security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/data-privacy?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Flanguage-service%2Fcontext%2Fcontext/?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n\\r\\nTransparency notes are part of a broader effort at Microsoft to put its [AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai/?azure-portal=true) into practice. Transparency notes can help you understand how the AI technology works. An AI system includes the technology, the people who use it and who will be affected by it, and the environment where it\\'s deployed. You can review the transparency note for [Azure Cognitive Service for Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/transparency-note/?azure-portal=true) and the one for [Text Analytics for health](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/transparency-note-health/?azure-portal=true). Both transparency notes offer valuable information that can help you build solutions by using the service.',\n",

       "   'content': \"# AI services on the Azure platform\\r\\n\\r\\nCompleted\\r\\n\\r\\n- 4 minutes\\r\\n\\r\\nAzure AI services are AI capabilities that can be built into web or mobile applications, in a way that's straightforward to implement. These AI services include image recognition, natural language processing, speech, AI-powered search, and more. There are over a dozen [different services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services#available-azure-ai-services?azure-portal=true) that can be used separately or together to add AI power to applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's take a look at some examples of what can be done with Azure AI services. The Azure AI Content Safety service can be used to detect harmful content within text or images, including violent or hateful content, and report on its severity. The Azure AI Language service can be used to summarize text, classify information, or extract key phrases. The Azure AI Speech service provides powerful speech to text and text to speech capabilities, allowing speech to be accurately transcribed into text, or text to natural sounding voice audio.\\r\\n\\r\\nAzure AI services are based on three principles that dramatically improve speed-to-market:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Prebuilt and ready to use\\r\\n- Accessed through APIs\\r\\n- Available on Azure\\r\\n\\r\\n## Azure AI services are prebuilt and ready to use\\r\\n\\r\\nAI has been prohibitive for all but the largest technology companies because of several factors, including the large amounts of data required to train models, the massive amount of computing power needed, and the budget to hire specialist programmers. Azure AI services make AI accessible to businesses of all sizes by using pre-trained machine learning models to deliver AI as a service. Azure AI services use high-performance Azure computing to deploy advanced AI models as resources, making decades of research available to developers of all skill levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAzure AI services are a portfolio of services, with capabilities suitable for use cases across sectors and industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, in education, Immersive Reader is being used to support students by adapting to their requirements. Learners can have varying needs, such as wanting to read more slowly, get words or text translated into another language, or see pictures to aid their understanding. Immersive Reader helps students with different needs learn at their own pace, and in their own way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Azure AI services can be used without any modification, some AI services can be customized to better fit specific requirements. Customization capabilities in Azure AI Vision, Azure AI Speech, and Azure OpenAI all allow you to add data to existing models.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, in sport, athletes, and coaches are customizing Azure AI Vision to improve performance and reduce injury. One application allows [surfers](https://unlocked.microsoft.com/usa-surf?azure-portal=true) to upload a video and receive AI-generated insights and analysis. These insights can then be used by coaches, medics, judges, and event broadcasters.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Azure AI services are accessed through APIs\\r\\n\\r\\nAzure AI services are designed to be used in different development environments, with minimal coding. Developers can access AI services through REST APIs, client libraries, or integrate them with tools such as Logic Apps and Power Automate. APIs are application programming interfaces that define the information that is required for one component to use the services of the other. APIs enable software components to communicate, so one side can be updated without stopping the other from working. Find out more about development options for Azure AI services [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services#use-azure-ai-services-in-different-development-environments?azure-portal=true).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Azure AI services are available on Azure\\r\\n\\r\\nAI services are cloud-based and accessed through Azure resource. This means that they're managed in the same way as other Azure services, such as platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or a managed database service. The Azure platform and Resource Manager provide a consistent framework for all your Azure services, from creating or deleting resources, to availability and billing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some situations, AI has the potential to be used in ways that might compromise an individual's privacy or rights. Microsoft has [six Responsible AI principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/trusted-ai?azure-portal=true) to help ensure AI services are ethical and fair. Because of this, certain Azure AI services are restricted to ensure they're used responsibly.\",\n",
